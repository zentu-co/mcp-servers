You are developing MCP servers.
We use pnpm for package management and running scripts.
The user must be running `pnpm dev` this will run two package.json scripts concurrently: `watch`, which watches for changes and rebuilds immediatly after changes and `inspector` which uses `pnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js` to inspect the MCP server. `inspector` will start a server in http://localhost:5173.
The transport type is STDIO so using console.log will not work.
The MCP servers will be used as part of Cline a VSCode extension.
You can't nor won't restart or build the MCP server, ask the user to run `pnpm dev` instead.
The debugging/inspector needs to be restarted everytime there's a change to the index.ts file (the MCP server, but the user needs to click "refresh" on the UI. For Cline the user needs to manually restart the server on the extension's UI.
